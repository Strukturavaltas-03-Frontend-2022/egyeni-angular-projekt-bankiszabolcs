# OverTheMoviezon

This site is about movies. All you need is to type `npm start` into the console.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.1.

Templates I used during the development created by Tailwind UI.

Data come from the 'https://nettuts.hu/jms/bankiszabolcs/cinema'. To make the website faster (considering this is a sample project) 
I left only 100 elements from the data incoming.
